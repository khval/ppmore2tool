# ppmore2tool
Unpack powerpacked text files, and open it in your favorite text viewer.
this tool is witten by Kjetil Hvalstrand

The original ppmore for classic Amiga is crashing on AmigaOS4.1, instead of wasting lots of hours trying to debug that old tool. 
I have decided to make wrapper. Ppmore2tool is not based on original ppmore command.
this program uses powerpacker.library version 38 or higher for AmigaOS4.1.

Copy ppmore into c:

Open shell, set your default text viewer.
using one of following commands.

* setenv ppmore2tool appdir:mutiviewer
* setenv ppmore2tool appdir:mutiview
* setenv ppmore2tool appdir:notepad
* setenv ppmore2tool appdir:evenmore
